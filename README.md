## Introduction
The Arsenal Fan Club Web Application is a platform designed for Dallas-based fans of Arsenal Football Club. It allows users to create profiles, engage with other fans, and participate in club-related activities. The application is built using a three-tier architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

## Architecture
The application is structured into three main tiers:
1. **Front-End**: Built with Node.js and Vue3, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.
2. **Back-End**: A Python Flask API that handles business logic and communicates with the database.
3. **Database**: A PostgreSQL database that stores user data and other relevant information.

All components are hosted on Heroku servers, ensuring reliable and scalable deployment.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and profile creation.
- **Basic UI Layout**: A user-friendly interface for easy navigation.

## Future Enhancements
The following features are planned for future development to enhance the user experience:
1. **Password Reset**:
   - Implement a secure password reset functionality to allow users to recover their accounts easily.
2. **Member Dashboard**:
   - Develop a comprehensive dashboard where members can view and update their personal information, track their points, and manage their settings.
3. **GPS Location Check-In**:
   - Introduce a feature that allows users to check in at designated locations, such as pubs, while watching games. This will enable users to earn points towards prizes and rewards.
4. **Message Board**:
   - Create a dynamic message board on the home page to display the latest team updates and announcements.
   - Enable members to post messages and engage in discussions with fellow fans.
These enhancements aim to provide a more interactive and rewarding experience for Arsenal fans, fostering a vibrant and connected community.

## The intention of this repo is for visibility into the project, not for replication so installation steps are not included.
